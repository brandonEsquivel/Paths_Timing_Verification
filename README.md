## Description
A behavioral description of a 4-mode counter is implemented in Verilog. This description will serve as a detailed and formal specification of the operation of the designed device, then verilog timing directives are used to check its paths and times with and without delays.
It is proposed as an assignment of the course Microelectronics: Silicon Systems of the School of Electrical Engineering of the University of Costa Rica

## Counter

A case statement is used to execute 4 modes of counter operation:

** Count up.

** Count down.

** Count three at a time up.

** Parallel charging.

# How to run - Makefile

if you feel lazy, just:

--make Allcounter-- 

inside the makefile you can find detailed comments of the complation, synth and simulation steps.

## For more information(in spanish) see the report inside the docs folder.
